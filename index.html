            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
              <h3> I'm Hampton, thank you for joining me on my path to become a web developer!</h3>
                <p>I currently live in Lakewood, Colorado. I moved here from North Carolina where I
                  was a music teacher and gigging drummer. I desired a change of scenery and while I miss home and southern
                  food, I love it here and I am beginning to learn more about myself since being away. I can say that 
                  I set myself apart from the pack because I'm the traveling musical coder!</p>

<!-- About Hampton  -->

        <section id="about">
          <hr>
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> Because of my musical background I come in to the field with experience traveling America and Europe with a small group of jazz musicians and teaching music camps at local schools.
              Why is that helpful for coding you ask? Well as of now I already posses many of the skills required for team building, 
              out of the box thinking, colaberation and the ability to take ownership. Now I just have to add the languages. But this is
              where things get exciting for me, at the crossroads of coding and life experience. I can some it up in three ways.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Coding has always been something I never believed I could do and to be doing it now at my current level is a reward in of itself.</li>
                <li>I love learning and to find out that there is no cap to what you can learn to do with coding is exciting!</li>
                <li>Being able to work all over the world, learning from experienced programmers and all while making money to take care of myself and loved ones is a dream come true. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>That is where <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> comes in. Thinkful has given me an oppertunity 
                to learn without having to work outside of my courses. I am grateful for the chance to pursue certification through the Engineering immersion program.</a>

              <p>Hopefully with time and effort I will be able to live and work in a way that supports my passions.</p>
