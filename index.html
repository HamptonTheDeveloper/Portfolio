            <h2>My Path Until Now</h2>
              <p>My degree from Elon University is in History Studies. To me, it is one of the most important fields. However in order to pursue a career in the subject, I needed to attend a graduate program. And for what? A small office and a slightly above average wage? It's likely I would have ended up teaching and teachers today are struggling to make ends meet, at any level of school. After years of odd jobs, playing music on the road, and teaching at a high school in North Carolina, I am looking for a way to improve my life. I desire comfort, freedom, and the ability to pursue my own dreams. I believe web development will put me on a path to make this happen.</p>

              <p>That is where <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> comes in. Thinkful has given me an oppertunity to learn without having to work outside of my courses. I am grateful for the chance to pursue this certification through the ISA program.</a>

              <p>Hopefully with time and effort I will be able to live and work in a way that supports my passions.</p>
