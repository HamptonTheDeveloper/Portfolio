            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
              <h3> I'm Hampton, thank you for joining me on my path to become a web developer!</h3>
                <p>
                  I’m currently living in Lakewood, Colorado. A little over a year ago, I moved here from North Carolina.
                  I grew up living and going to school in an area called The Triangle, where I was a teacher and gigging drummer.
                  While I miss home and southern food, I wanted a change of scenery, and I needed to go on a bit of an adventure.
                  Since moving, I have learned a lot about myself and I’ve fallen in love with Colorado, but there is a lot more I would like to achieve.
                  I’ve now set my sights on becoming a traveling musical coder, but I do not have an easy path ahead of me. 
                  While my personal history as an artist may set me apart, I am learning to earn my place in the software engineering family. </p>

<!-- About Hampton  -->

        <section id="about">

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              I became interested in programming while working as a teacher. After a young student's music lesson,
              one of the parents and I were talking about important skills children should learn.
              I explained that knowing how to play music opened doors for me, and learning to play with others can help kids learn social skills and logical thinking. 
              He responded that coding is similar because it opens doors, can connect others, and requires a different type of logical thinking.
              It was at that point that I began looking at the internet and the web differently. I started to see them as polyphony. 
              And with that realization, I developed a deep interest in what the internet and web are but was unable to foster a deep understanding for them.
              A few years later while living in Colorado, Covid-19 lockdowns were beginning to be discussed, 
              my girlfriend suggested I should look into coding as something to get into during the shutdown. 
              But before that day, I would have struggled to imagine myself learning even a single web language.
            </p>
            <p> 
              I was a visual artist for many years but focused on music before software engineering. 
              I have briefly traveled America and Europe with a small group of jazz musicians, playing shows, and festivals where we went.
              While home, I played live shows for multiple local acts and recorded music for a handful of artists in the area.
              After that, I taught music camps at local schools and had private students of all ages.
              In addition to those musical endeavors and also working many jobs in many fields,
              I have been exposed to a variety of learning environments, types of pressure, and team dynamics.
              During that time I was required to fix issues quickly, improvise on many levels, and incorporate new ideas on short notice
              - all skills developers employ daily.
              Additionally, I learned of many personal shortcomings and have adopted the attitude of working every day to improve them.
              Throughout my life, I have spent time practicing out-of-the-box thinking and have learned 
              the valuable ability to take ownership when collaborating with others.
              Now I just want to find my band of fellow developers and continue to get better.</p> <br>
              <p>In short:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Coding was something I didn’t believe I could do as a musician, but to be coding now at my current level is a reward in itself.</li>
                <li>I love learning and to find out that the languages of the web are always developing is exciting!</li>
                <li>Being able to work all over the world, learning from working with experienced programmers, 
                  and all while making money to take care of myself and loved ones is a dream come true. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>As far back as I remember, I’ve been focused on artistic ability. My parents taught me to love traveling and develop a deeper appreciation for music. 
                I made sure my passion for music and art was always foregrounded in everything I did, and now I am learning to code through this same creative lens. 
                Walking through art museums and cathedrals while frequenting music festivals didn’t expose me to the idea of web development in any tangible way. 
                And in college, I studied humanities with blinders on to the tech world, except for on the occasion when tech and sociology meshed in a way I could analyze. 
                But I think this gifted me a unique perspective. I hope that this outlook of mine can provide unique attention to the code I write and the people it affects. 
                Once I attain some basic mastery over a small group of languages my imagination can have an impact in a space I once felt blocked from.
              </p>
              <p>That is where <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> comes in. Thinkful has allowed me 
                to learn without having to work outside of my courses. I am grateful for the chance to pursue certification 
                through the Engineering Immersion program because I am learning how to provide services that clients and employers want their developers to know. Services such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Addressing front-end and back-end issues</li>
                  <li>Working with various teams to complete goals</li>
                  <li>Using personal time to stay up on trends in the development world</li>
                </ul>

              <p>I believe with time and effort software engineering will help me open even more doors, and allow me to live in a way that is in line with my creativity.</p>
