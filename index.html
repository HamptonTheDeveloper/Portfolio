            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
              <h3> I'm Hampton, thank you for joining me on my path to become a web developer!</h3>
                <p>I currently live in Lakewood, Colorado. I moved here from North Carolina where I
                  was a music teacher and gigging drummer. I desired a change of scenery and while I miss home and southern
                  food, I love it here and I am beginning to learn more about myself since being away. I can say that 
                  I set myself apart from the pack because I'm the traveling musical coder!</p>

<!-- About Hampton  -->

        <section id="about">
          <hr>
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I started developing the itch for programming when one of my student's parents and I were talking about important skills for todays world. I was explaining that knowing how to play music with others
              is helpful socially and with learning to think logically in some respects. His response to me was that coding was similar in it's ability to connect others and teach logic. It was at that point that the internet changed in my eyes.
              it became the music of logic. And with that realization I developed a deep passion for what we created in the web, despite it's ugly reflection at times. 
            </p>
            <p> Because of my musical background I come in to the field with experience traveling America and Europe with a small group of 
              jazz musicians and teaching music camps at local schools.
              Why is that helpful for coding you ask? 
              Well as of now I already posses some of the skills required for team building, and I know many of my shortcomings in team settings. I have spent time learning out of the box thinking as far a music,
              and as far as collaberation I have learned the valuable ability to take ownership. Now I just want to find my band of fellow developers and keep learning. But this is
              where things get exciting for me, at the crossroads of coding and life experience. I can some it up in three ways.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Coding has always been something I never believed I could do and to be doing it now at my current level is a reward in of itself.</li>
                <li>I love learning and to find out that there is no cap to what you can learn to do with coding is exciting!</li>
                <li>Being able to work all over the world, learning from experienced programmers and all while making money to take care of myself and loved ones is a dream come true. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>What is funny to me about all this is that I could't see myself as a coder even 4 months ago. My personality has always been art focused. Since a kid all I cared about was music and my parents were avid travelers and music goers. 
                So walking through art museums and cathedrals while alternating between music festivals from a young age, I was never exposed to web development or coding of any sort. And even in college I studied humanities with blinders on to tech,
                with exception to spaces where tech and sociology crossed. As I said however this is what sets me apart - not better than any other at this stage neccessarily, but different. Hopefully, with this outlook of mine, I can provide unique attention to the code I write and the people it affects, 
                but my services don't stop with a different outlook. I aim to provide my employer or customer high quality coding, written with correct syntax and simplified thinking, delivered on time. 
              </p>
              <p>That is where <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> comes in. Thinkful has given me an oppertunity 
                to learn without having to work outside of my courses. I am grateful for the chance to pursue certification through the Engineering immersion program.</a>

              <p>Hopefully with time and effort I will be able to live and work in a way that supports my passions.</p>
