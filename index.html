            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
              <h3> I'm Hampton, thank you for joining me on my path to become a web developer!</h3>
                <p>I’m currently living in Lakewood, Colorado. A little over a year ago, I moved here from North Carolina where I was a music teacher and gigging drummer.
                   While I miss home and southern food, I really wanted a change of scenery. Since moving, I’ve learned a lot about myself and I’ve fallen in love with Colorado.
                    I’ve now become a traveling musical coder, in my eyes, setting myself apart from other people in the software engineering field. </p>

<!-- About Hampton  -->

        <section id="about">
          <hr>
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I became interested in programming when I was teaching music and one of the parents and I were talking about important skills for today's world.
              I explained that knowing how to play music with others helps you learn social skills and logical thinking. 
              His response was that coding is similar because it has the ability to connect others and requires even more logical thinking.
              It was at that point that I began looking at the internet differently and started to see it as polyphony. 
              And with that realization, I developed a deep passion for what is and can be created on the internet.
            </p>
            <p> I’ve traveled America and Europe with a small group of jazz musicians and taught music camps at local schools. These life experiences translate to coding because during these experiences I developed team building skills.
              Additionally, I learned of my shortcomings in team settings and how to work through them. 
              Throughout my life, I have spent time practicing out-of-the-box thinking and have learned the valuable ability to take ownership when collaborating with others.
              Now I just want to find my band of fellow developers and keep learning. At the crossroads of coding and life experience, this is where things get exciting for me. It boils down to this:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Coding has always been something I never believed I could do and to be doing it now at my current level is a reward in of itself.</li>
                <li>I love learning and to find out that there is no cap to what you can learn to do with coding is exciting!</li>
                <li>Being able to work all over the world, learning from experienced programmers and all while making money to take care of myself and loved ones is a dream come true. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Just four months ago, I couldn’t have seen myself as a coder. As far back as I remember, I’ve been focused on art. My parents taught me to love traveling and develop a deeper appreciation for music. 
                However, walking through art museums and cathedrals while alternating between music festivals from a young age, didn’t expose me to the idea of web development. 
                In college, I studied humanities with blinders on to the tech world, except for on the occasion when tech and sociology crossed. 
                But I think this gifted me a unique perspective. My hope is that this outlook of mine can provide unique attention to the code I write and the people it affects. 
                I aim to provide my unique viewpoint for my employer or customer, high-quality coding, written with subtle and simplified thinking, delivered in a timely manner.
              </p>
              <p>That is where <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> comes in. Thinkful has given me an oppertunity 
                to learn without having to work outside of my courses. I am grateful for the chance to pursue certification through the Engineering immersion program.</a>

              <p>Hopefully with time and effort I will be able to live and work in a way that supports my passions.</p>
